### Installing AWS CLI

I did not install AWS CLI because i already had it installed on my local machine but for ease of reference on how to install it,
I am providing instructions on how to install it on mac

i did the following steps to install my AWS CLI
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
```

```
sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

To verify that the shell can find and run the aws command in your $PATH, use the following commands.
```
which aws
aws --version
```
